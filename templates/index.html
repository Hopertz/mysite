        <h1>Hopertz's Site</h1>
        <p> Welcome to my personal website! It took me about 3 days just to make and deploy this site.
            Procrastination is my whole life in one definition.
            I can make a better website but i have just decided to make it look simple.I like it. ¬Ø\_‡ºº ‚Ä¢ÃÅ Õú ñ ‚Ä¢ÃÄ ‡ºΩ_/¬Ø</p>

        <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
        <p>Tanzania male
        <span id="age"><noscript>born in 1998</noscript></span>.
        I have been programming
        <span id="programming"><noscript>since 2018</noscript></span>
        and i think it's my passion (maybe), not totally sure.</p>

        <p>I enjoy having rest (kupoa), playing video-games,
        fantasizing, eating or do things that i can't do.</p>

        <p> I can talk perfect, read and write both English and swahili.Currently learning russian language.
            I have programmed in Python,JavaScript and designed pages like this with plain HTML
            and CSS.Just imagine i have used Django framework as backend for this site,which is probably an overkill.</p>

        <p> On the Internet, I'm often known as <strong>Hopertz</strong>, although
            my real name is Lugano Abel.</p>
